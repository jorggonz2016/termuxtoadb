# WIP GUI Version
### This is a python WIP version that only works on windows at the moment.

## Why you should use this
### This program gives you full desktop management of your phone with little time wasted on the setup. Just plug in your phone and type one command. This script also avoids using the port 22 because it fixes a problem newer phones have where you cannot access certain ports.

# Your steps:

1) On termux, do "apt install openssh" and "sshd -p8022"
2) Just do what the program says.

## General windows file explorer tip, 
##### hold shift and click on adb.exe. There should be a option to copy the path to the file.
